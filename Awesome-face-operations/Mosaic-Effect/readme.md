### Introduction:
A photomosaic is an image split into a grid of rectangles, with each replaced by another image that matches the target (the image you ultimately want to appear in the photomosaic). In other words, if you look at a photomosaic from a distance, you see the target image; but if you come closer, you will see that the image actually consists of many smaller images. This works because of how the human eye works.

### Steps:
- Read the tile images, which will replace the tiles in the original image.
- Read the target image and split it into an M×N grid of tiles.
- For each tile, fnd the best match from the input images.
- Create the fnal mosaic by arranging the selected input images in an M×N grid.
